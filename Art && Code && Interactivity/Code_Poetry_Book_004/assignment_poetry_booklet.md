#### 1. Read and Consult

Read all the code poems completed by the students of Shawn Lawson's Art && Code && Interactivity Fall 2019 course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

Understand the meaning and essence of each poem.

Consult each student about the presentation and publication of their code.

We also modified the the output of each poem for translation from a digital (computer) to analog (physical book) and for visual appeal.
