collection of project work from Fall 2019 ACI course 

stretching art and code through interactive experience artwork

### Course Outcomes:

1. Create interactive experiences with OpenFrameworks
2. Break down a conceptual idea into manageable technical parts
3. Solve a projectâ€™s unknown, unknowns

Course Abstract: Art && Code && Interactivity is primarily concerned with: learning how to build any interactive experience artwork from concept to completion and stretching the definition of art and the definition of code.

#### 1. Graphics && Sound

I created a digital map of the soundscapes of the Poestenskill Canal and Hudson River located in South Troy and South Central Troy, NY. 

By capturing and sharing sounds in theese spaces, this project aims to enage people in such public spaces, which are inaccessible to and disconnected from surrounding communtiies and don't feel very "public" at all.

[Language: C++ | Toolkit: open-source toolkit openFrameworks | IDE: Xcode]


#### 2. Camera

I created a virtual graffiti wall. This interactive experience artwork creates graffiti art using a computer vision system and color tracking.

By tracking the top of a water bottle representing a spray pain can and using a wireless mouse to switch between cursor/selection and painting modes, participants express their own artistic creations.

The canvas background resembles the southwest facade of EMPAC building at RPI. This background was chosen because of the current tensions among students and the RPI adminstration concerning student rights and freedom, control, surveillance, censorship, and protests.

#### 3. Code Poetry

I wrote a poem in Python titled life_changes about the chaos theory in relation to changes in one's lifetime. When executed, code generates an unique fractal tree.

What is a code poem?
1. It must be "code"
2. It must be a "poem"
3. It must run -- is a valid computer program which produces a
representation of itself when compiled and run

#### 4. Code Poetry Book

A published collection of all code poems completed by the students of Shawn Lawson's Art && Code && Interactivity Fall 2019 course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

I designed and co-edited the publication with Boyuan Zheng. We  truncated the code to emphasize its poetic nature in analog form. We also modified the the output of each poem for translation from a digital (computer) to analog (physical book) and for visual appeal.
