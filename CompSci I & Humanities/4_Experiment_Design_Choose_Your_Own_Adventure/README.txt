STORY NARRATIVE: 

BEES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS

Almost all flowering plants, such as food crops, depend on pollinators.At least 1/3 of what we eat relies on animal pollinators, such as honeybees.

MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHING BEES

Clint is a commercial beekeeper with healthy beehives. He offers the beehives’ services as pollinators to growers of a variety of crops across the United States. While his honeybees were pollinating cotton fields in Texas, they 'collapsed' mysteriously—the bees abandoned their beehives and did not return. As the mysterious collapses persisted and intensified, bee researched termed it ‘colony collapse disorder’ or CCD. By 2006, beekeepers (commercial and recreational)in the United States had lost between 15% to 75% of their beehives due to CCD.

THE CCD CONTROVERSY

Stakeholders, including as researchers, beekeepers, crop growers, government regulators, and agrochemical companies, have different understandings of what CCD is, what causes it, and what should be done about it. Most agree that we do not understand why beehives become susceptible to CCD in the first place.

GAME: CREATE YOUR OWN EXPERIMENT
You are a honeybee scientist. You are interested in investigating the link between newer systemic pesticides and CCD. You need to design your next experiment.

q0 = Test **one** direct causal factor or test **multiple** indirect factors?


text1 = Testing a direct, causal effect emphasizes precision and control, rather than reflecting nature’s complexity. Now, you need to decide the level of pesticides you will expose the bees to.'
q1 = Test a **high** or **low** dose of pesticide?

text2 = You will be working in actual fields and bee yards to engage with multiple and indirect ways pesticides contribute to CCD. Such an approach takes into account the interactive and cumulative factors of the complex CCD phenomenon. Think about what sorts of measures may provide you with useful information about aspects of the hives.
q2 = Record **formal** measures, such as the number of comb cells containing immature bees (or brood) and nectar and pollen stored by foraging honeybees inside each beehive, or **informal** measures, such as brood pattern and the number of frames covered with bees?

text3= Higher doses are more likely to produce clear and conclusive results. You may perform your study in a laboratory setting or in fields and bee yards.
q3 = Will the experiment take place in a **lab** or **field**?

text4 = Low doses model the likely exposure bees have on agricultural fields. You may perform your study in a laboratory setting or in fields and bee yards.
q4 = q3

text5 = Using formal and narrowly quantitative measures is the standard among the
scientific community. Next, decide on whether you will be studying honeybees that are chronically or acutely exposed to pesticides.
q5 = Will the study be over a **long** or **short** period of time?

text6 = Although informal measures are more often used by commercial beekeepers to assess hive health, than by scientists, these measures consider the multidimensional aspects of a
hive, rather than splitting up a hive as isolated units. Next, decide on whether you will
be studying honeybees that are chronically or acutely exposed to pesticides.
q6 = q5

text7 = While field studies may provide more realistic conditions, you will need to seek experimental control of all potentially confounding environmental variables. For example,
consider how you might keep the honeybees in your control plot from traveling to the treated plot?
q7 = Type **next**

text8 = Laboratory settings provide you with greater control and precision.
q8 = q7

text9 = text7
q9 = q7

text10 = text8
q10 = q7

text11 = Beekeepers support your choice to study the chronic effects of pesticide exposure because it considers CCD may be caused by accumulated factors over the long term. In order to conduct your study, you need to submit your experiment proposal to grant funding
agencies.
q11 = **Submit** your experiment design for funding.

text12 = Shorter time frames allow you to conduct multiple trials of your experiment. Plus, as the EPA's toxicity tests also focus on acute toxicity, you will be following a well-established research practice. In order to conduct your study, you need to submit your
experiment proposal to grant funding agencies.
q12 = q11

text13= text11
q13= q11

text14 = text12
q14 = q11

text15 = It has only been 1 week since you had submitted your experiment proposals and it looks like you've received several responses.
q15 = q7

text16 = text15
q16 = q7

text17 = All of your applications were denied. One letter mentioned that while the agency appreciated your consideration for the variety of factors that may be involved, your experiment would produce, at best, suggestive evidence. The agency was looking for experiments that could produce definitive causal evidence.
q17 = Do you want to **end** or **restart** game?

text18 = A beekeeping trade association replied confirming that received your application and it is currently pending review. The other response you received rejected your use of the measures developed by beekeepers because apparently, scientists are the supposedly objective ones and are the experts here.
q18 = q17

text19 = Experiment Results: bees in the dosed group were significantly more vulnerable to infection than bees from the control group
Critique from Stakeholders: the high doses you used are not field-realistic
q19 = q17

text20 = Experiment Results: Only at a particular high dosage levels does half of the treated group die within several days.
Consequences: Your study was published in high-prestige scientific journals. The EPA Standard LD50 was created based on studies, including your’s, that set dosage levels below as allowed and as causing no observed adverse effects to bees.'
q20 = q17

text21 = Experiment Results: no effects were observed in bee colonies exposed to field-realistic (low) dosages
Critique From Stakeholders: skeptical of reliability since bees experience a vast amount of environment variability in field studies
q21 = q17

text22 = Experiment Results: honeybee colonies chronically exposed to low levels of pesticides are not harmed
Critique From Stakeholders: lacks relevancy to bee colonies in natural conditions
q22 = q17
