QUESTION 1: Why do you think Liu et. al. choose to use product reviews as the 
dataset for their sentiment analysis testing? How does that kind of dataset 
differ from the datasets that Safiya Noble addresses in her chapter?

A) I think Liu et. al. chose to use product reviews to test their sentiment
analysis because product reviews are a relatively simple, focused, and
straightforward application for such analysis.

B)
The product review datasets used by Liu et. al. to preform sentiment analysis
are very different than datasets Noble addresses in her chapter. Safiya Noble
addresses the datasets Google uses to generate its semantic maps and return
search results. Such datasets include everything on the internet.

First, the correlation between the function of the data and the function of
the analysis differs among datasets. For example, when one is posting a
product review, one is aware that their post will be read by and influence
prospective buyers and the product's company. In this case, both the data
created and analysis preformed were done for the purpose of reviewing a
product. In contrast, when one is posting something somewhere on the internet,
they tend to not be aware (at the moment at the very least) their post will be
analyzed by Google for making connections among search terms and results, which
could affect all Google search engine users. Therefore, one's intent behind a
particular post will not likely correspond with the purposes for Google's use
of the post. This difference reflects the stark contrast between the scope of
each dataset. While Liu et. al.'s dataset occupies a narrow domain of review
for a particular product, Google's dataset dataset occupies the broadest possible
domain.

As product reviews are a relatively focused activity and with several sentiment 
possibilities (e.g. positive, neutral, or negative), it may be easier for the
sentiment analysis to extract meaning and make more accurate assumptions from the
dataset. As Google's dataset of online content has infinite possibilities and no
context, it is much more difficult to extract meaning or make accurate assumptions
from the user's search terms. Since Google does not know the context nor intent of
the person entering the search term, the search engine does not know what that 
individual is looking for. Consequently, Google's algorithm bases that individual's
search results on the past successful search experiences of anyone in the world
looking for anything (including porn enthusiasts and racists).

In summary, sentiment analysis is more likely to product accurate results for Liu et.
al.'s dataset of product review, as opposed to Google internet content dataset,
because of its defined context, specific question, and simple landscape.

C)
Another key difference between the two datasets are the associations and perceptions
of each data type. Product reviews are widely recognized as one's personal opinion.
It is associated with bias and opinion, not fact. In contrast, many people today
associate Google's search engine results with truth. Such search results are too often
seen as the objective and neutral output of a search engine dedicated to information.
Given these associations, Google's dataset has much more power in society than product
review datasets.

QUESTION 2: In what ways could this kind of sentiment analysis be used by 
companies like Google to address race and gender-based violence in their 
systems?

Companies like Google to use sentimental analysis to address race and 
gender-based violence in their systems. For example, they could create
racial and gender-based sentiments, then use the analysis to filter/censor
results or be reviewed by humans to refine the algorithm's code. Companies
could also apply such a sentiment analysis to potential search results. 
After scoring a variety of potential results, the items with higher scores
could guide companies to review such strong connections and help them
prioritize what to focus their efforts on correcting.

Additionally, the sentiment tests could be more complex in that they could
be more contextualized or linked sentiments. For instance, rather than
testing for a single word, the test may look for a combination of words in
close proximation or adjacent words (e.g. "hate" + gender).

-----------------

QUESTION 3: What are kinds of bias that this sentiment analysis would fail to
pick up? In your response, consider some of the overlapping kinds of “texts” 
that are a part of digital objects, such as readable text, metatags, images, 
and links.

Sentiment analysis would fail when it is trying to compare different kinds texts.
For example, if a the sentiment analysis is looking for a the word "hate", it 
will not likely find the word anywhere if its looking through images because the
computer only sees the data for the pixels of an image or its html <img> tag. In
other words, you can only compare apples to apples, not apples to oranges.

Sentiment analysis could also fail based on what it has been programmed to preform
analysis on and not on. For example, sentiment analysis may only preform testing on
readable text, leaving out other forms of text, such as urls. If the sentiment
analysis overlooked the the url, then the analysis would fail to pickup if the url
(or the base url) points to something with significant sentiment. In summary, what
the sentiment analysis is programmed to test on may introduce bias.

MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  

For analysis #7 (if there positive/negative word matches in the headline), I chose to print a qualitative result (positive, neutral, or negative) because I thought this measure would be more helpful to the reviewer of analysis results, as opposed to True/False or the number of positive/negative words.

Feedback on assignment: I wish we had a bit more freedom on this assignment. Perhaps, you could include 3 specific analyses we have to preform, then a certain number of quantitative and and qualitative analyses of our choice (then explaining our choices in the ReadMe.txt.
